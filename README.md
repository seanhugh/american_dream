### Overview

Why has the probability that a child will make more than their parents decreased since 1940? I analyzed "The American Dream" dataset by Raj Chetty which poses this question. He concludes that income inequality is the main source of the decreasing probability. I compare his compiled data with US income inequality statistics to test his conclusion. I also analyze the dataset with regards to different income brackets to see how these changes have affected the poor and the rich.

### Background

[Raj Chetty](https://economics.harvard.edu/people/raj-chetty) is a proffesor at Harvard University. His paper, [The American Dream](https://opportunityinsights.org/paper/the-fading-american-dream/) is a great resource to further explore this topic. This project has been featured in several reputable news sources including [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/08/opinion/the-american-dream-quantified-at-last.html) and [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/01/why-is-the-american-dream-dead-in-the-south/283313/).

### Data Sources

I used data from the [American Dream Data]("https://opportunityinsights.org/data/?geographic_level=0&topic=0&paper_id=546#resource-listing"). Specifically I used the "Absolute Income Mobility by Child Birth Cohort and State" and "
Fading American Dream: Baseline Estimates of Absolute Mobility by Parent Income Percentile and Child Birth Cohort" datasets. I compared these datasets with US inequality data drawn from the [World Inequality Database](https://wid.world/data/#countrytimeseries/sfiinc_p99p100_z/US/1913/2015/eu/k/p/yearly/s).
