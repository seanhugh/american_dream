# Gov1005 Final project

### Overview

Final Data Project for gov1005. For this project I will be comparing two datasets in an attempt to explore the realtionship between some psychological traits of a country's inhabitants and the financial traits of the country. (i.e. generosity vs. income inequality)

### Data Set 1
I will be getting data involving psychology of monetary transactions that is used in the following paper: https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4955/957218943549c0fcd0693fa147bf136ecbc3.pdf?_ga=2.81044369.722756004.1535632846-1956353776.1505570584. I am still looking for the best way to get this data. (besides just copying it from their charts).

### Data Set 2
I am still looking for the best dataset to use for income inequality data in the different countries. Currently, I have found some databases from world bank that look interesting.
